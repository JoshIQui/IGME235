    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        <em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition</em> is a remake of the original <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> with updated graphics and a<br>
        somewhat different art style. Changes in content are minimal, and mostly consist of quality of life features such as<br>
        difficulty settings, an improved quest tracker, and fashion gear. New content includes a time trials mode and a handful of<br>
        new equipment sets.<br><br>

        <em>Definitive Edition</em> also includes a brand-new epilogue chapter, <em>Future Connected</em>, which can be accessed at any time<br>
        independent of progress in the main game. One year after the events of the original game, Shulk and Melia set off for the<br>
        imperial city of Alcamoth, of which the latter is crown princess. However, a malevolent, incorporeal being called the Fog<br>
        King has appeared in the city from a rift in space-time and driven the residents to the Bionis' Shoulder. Tensions between<br>
        the survivors have fractured their community, leaving them with little hope of ever returning to their homeland. Melia takes<br>
        it upon herself to reunite her people and retake the capital, and in the process prove her worth as heir to the throne.<br><br>

        Shulk and Melia are joined in their quest by a pair of Nopon named Nene and Kino, children of Riki who wish to follow in<br>
        their father's footsteps and become heroes. The party are also able to recruit the Ponspectors, a Nopon survey crew who<br>
        offer their assistance in battle. In addition to randomly jumping in to use special skills, the Ponspectors can combine their<br>
        power to launch an all-out attack against the enemy. Other mechanics from the main game have been streamlined or<br>
        removed to better fit the shorter campaign.<br><br>

    <p>
        All in all, if you’ve been waiting to play Xenoblade Chronicles for any reason, now is the time to do it.<br>
        Having never taken the plunge with its initial release on the Wii, or its re-release on the 3DS, the Definitive<br>
        Edition is just that. It’s a beautiful game with a great story that finally feels like it's found the system it deserves.<br>
