        About Me
    </h1>

    <p id="biography">
        As a video game enthusiast, I take pride in my role as a Game Design and Development student. I aspire to be a great game developer like
        the ones that people look up to. I hope that this class will teach me how to use the necessary tools to have an online existence that will
        assist my game development career. I am currently a second-year student at RIT, so I will be looking for a co-op soon. I hope that I can get
        a job in the video game industry when i graduate. For now, I'm just a chill, but fun guy.
